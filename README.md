# App made for Shopify's winter 2022 Internships

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Libraries Used

## `Material UI`

## `axios`

## `rsuite`

## `date-fns`

## `react-copy-to-clipboard`

## `styled-components`


I had a lot of fun with this app. I wanted to challenge myself by using libraries I have never used before so this was my first time using every library posted above besides axios and styled components.
